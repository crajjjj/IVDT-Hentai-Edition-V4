A list of slots to loop for to look for armor to swapped for the lewd version.
they must be separated by commas as shown in the ArmorSwapping.json file

form :

Before and After .Armors to be swapped for when a sexlab scene starts. note that armor name must all be in lower case letter, otherwise it wont work with papyrusutil
  "name of armor in all lower case letters" : "armor form",

refer to ArmorSwapping.json for examples.

its important to Note that this is the config setup based on the author's load order, which includes turning all outfit mods into ESL if not already.
while it should be very common for outfit mods to be released with ESL plugins, i cannot guarantee the formid in this config to be of match of the outfit mod during.
Hence you can add your own outfit configs in the ArmorSwapping.json file
